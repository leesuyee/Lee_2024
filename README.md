# Lee_2024
Scripts and dataframes for recreating analyses in Lee, et al., 2024 relating to the connectivity of the Drosophila femoral chordotonal organ (FeCO). 

Also included is a pdf of the supplemental tables "____.pdf", which feature links to the reconstructed neurons.

This repository can be used with or without access to the FANC materialization:
1. Without access, dataframes are included to run through scripts for recreating analyses and plots from Lee et al., 2024
2. With access, scripts are included for recreating dataframes, so that the analysis pipeline can be accessed in the future as the connectome proofreading progresses.
